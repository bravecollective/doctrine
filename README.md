Brave Doctrine Contracts
========================

An EVE Online ship fitting management and contract validation system.

© 2014 Carl G. Evans and contributors.

Written in C# MVC.

##1. What is Brave Doctrine Contracts?

Brave Doctrine Contracts can help to improve the organisation and standardisation of EVE Online fleet doctrines and ensure that alliance/corporation members are flying the correct fits in the shortest amount of time possible.

Members can be sure that they are flying the most up-to-date fitting and that the contracts they are buying have all of the valid components; including ammunition, drones, scripts and repair paste. Invalid contracts are shown in red and can be filtered out.

Move the control of the contracts market back to corporation or alliance management. If sales agents consistently add invalid contracts or attempt to extort members they can be disabled.

Standardise on contract pricing with account-wide profit margin calculations based upon current market data.

Send out fleet pings with a shortened URL for the doctrine you wish members to use. The URL can contain various parameters to filter only valid contracts for the current station and for all ships in a particular doctrine.

Manage contract availability levels and receive alerts when custom thresholds are reached.

##2. Features

Here are some of the features and tools currently available with the system:

* Contract validity checking.
* Contract sorting/filtering with custom URLs for fleet pings.
* Contract availability monitoring and twitter alerts.
* Ship fit imports from EVE XML format (supports bulk import).
* Ship fit details with up-to-date market data.
* Ship fit buying tool.
* Account-level control over settings such as profit percentages.
* Manage sales agents, ship fittings and account permissions/access codes.
